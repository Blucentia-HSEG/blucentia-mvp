# Blucentia MVP

**Blucentia** is the AI-powered platform for workplace transparency and human sustainability — built using the HSEG™ (Human Sustainability Evaluation Grid) standard.

We are building the next layer of internal ESG — one that measures not just environmental or governance performance, but **how organizations treat people.**

## 💡 What This MVP Demonstrates

This public-facing MVP was created during the Soonami Venturethon as a prototype of the Blucentia platform.

It currently includes:
- A frontend prototype for submitting cultural feedback
- Placeholder flow for anonymous input → AI analysis → scoring output
- Early UI components reflecting HSEG score interpretation
- Future integration points for the private scoring engine

> ⚠️ This MVP does **not** include our proprietary AI models, risk detection prompts, or cultural scoring logic. That logic is maintained in a private repository.

## 🧠 What Is HSEG™?

**HSEG™ (Human Sustainability Evaluation Grid)** is a new AI-driven framework that quantifies workplace culture through the lens of:

- 🔹 Psychological safety  
- 🔹 Empathy and ethics  
- 🔹 Governance of interpersonal power  
- 🔹 Transparency and accountability

Blucentia is the first platform built to operationalize HSEG scores across industries.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack (MVP)

This MVP is being rapidly developed during the Venturethon. The current tech stack is lightweight and evolving based on contributor preference and deployment speed.

- **Frontend:** Currently testing React, Streamlit, and no-code options (e.g., Webflow)
- **Scoring Logic:** Private LLM pipeline (not included in this repo)
- **Deployment:** Will depend on MVP direction (likely Vercel, Streamlit Cloud, or similar)

> Final architecture will be determined based on validated user needs and pilot partner feedback.
